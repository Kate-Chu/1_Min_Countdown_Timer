<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Many times I quit daily meditation because of excuses like too tired, too busy, too much works, etc.. Even though I understand it helps me to relax and be healthier. So I make this timer. Just ONE minute a day. Dive shortly but deeply, and it still helps well. At time over, the handbell ring sounds. It's a very soft sound so make sure you won't be disturbed if you want to continue.</p>
